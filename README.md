# Task.3-Iris-Flower-Classification

Iris Flower Classification
Overview:
The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic machine learning endeavor that involves predicting the species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal dimensions. This project utilizes the famous Iris dataset to explore and implement different classification algorithms, providing an educational and practical example of machine learning classification.

Features:
Data Exploration: Delve into the well-known Iris dataset to understand the characteristics of different iris flower species, exploring the relationships between sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset for machine learning by handling any missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing or normalizing features.

Machine Learning Models: Implement various classification algorithms, such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), to predict the iris species based on input features.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of each machine learning model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Identify the strengths and weaknesses of different algorithms.

Interactive Dashboard: Create visualizations and an interactive dashboard using tools like Power BI to showcase the results, decision boundaries, and insights derived from the classification models.

Technologies Used:
Python for data preprocessing and machine learning model development.
Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis and model training.
Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for data manipulation and machine learning.
 
GitHub for version control and collaboration.
